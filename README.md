# Q1. Development Assignment

## Level 1: API Calls
_Make a script that makes API calls to an LLM API (like gemma, grok). The script should take input from a text file and save the received responses in a .json file. Specifics are detailed in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DaSH-Lab-CSIS/DaSH-Lab-Assignment-2024/blob/main/DevelopmentAssignment/README.md)._

## Approach 
### Choice of LLM API: **Groq** [(API Cookbook)](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook) [Docs](https://console.groq.com/docs/quickstart)
  * Extensive, easy-to-read documentation when compared to Gemma + new and upcoming.
  * Support of multiple models and agent calling.
  * Faster output speeds and low latency.
